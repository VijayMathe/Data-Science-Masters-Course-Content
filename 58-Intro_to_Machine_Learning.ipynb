After training the model from the dataset whenever the model gets the new datapoints it will predict the output.  In supervised learning, the algorithm is provided with a dataset in which each data point has both input features and corresponding target labels. The algorithm learns from this labeled data by finding patterns and relationships between the input features and the target labels, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
