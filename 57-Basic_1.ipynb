Examples of ordinal data include educational levels (elementary, high school, college), satisfaction ratings (poor, fair, good, excellent), and survey response options (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree).\n",

Common examples of interval data include temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit, dates, and years. In interval data, you can perform mathematical operations like addition and subtraction, but multiplication and division are not meaningful.\n",

    "### Continuous Data: Continuous data can take any value within a certain range and can have an infinite number of possible values. It is typically measured on a continuous scale. Examples of continuous data include height, weight, temperature, and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Data: Discrete data can only take specific, distinct values. It cannot take any value within a range. Discrete data often consists of counts or whole numbers. Examples of discrete data include the number of children in a family, the number of customers in a store, or the number of defective items produced in a factory."
