    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used to classify data.

The leaves of the tree represent the final classifications.\n",

Based on the answer to the question, it follows the corresponding branch to the next node. This process continues until it reaches a leaf node, which represents the final classification.\n",
