    "### Ans:\n",
    "### Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and is unable to generalize to new data. Regularization adds a penalty to the cost function that discourages the model from learning too complex of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are two main types of regularization: L1 regularization and L2 regularization. L1 regularization adds a penalty to the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters. This encourages the model to have fewer features with large coefficients. L2 regularization adds a penalty to the sum of the squared values of the model parameters. This encourages the model to have all features with small coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization can be used with any machine learning algorithm, but it is particularly effective with logistic regression. This is because logistic regression is a nonlinear model, and it is more likely to overfit than a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here is an example of how regularization can help prevent overfitting. Let's say we have a dataset with 100 data points. We train a logistic regression model on the dataset, and the model achieves a training accuracy of 99%. However, when we test the model on new data, the accuracy is only 80%. This suggests that the model is overfitting the training data."
